## How to use

We have created an audio tour for those who want to explore the building and hear from the roboticists themselves â€“ just visit the building at 2505 Hayward St., Ann Arbor, Michigan from Monday through Friday, 7am to 7pm with your mobile device and headphones, and follow the audio tour signs.

Alternatively, visit remotely! It's just a website after all. You may miss being able to look directly into the labs, but the tour can still give you a sense of the work and motivations of Michigan roboticists.
